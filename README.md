> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.

Go ahead and take a peek at the solutions.
