Harvard [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/): Introduction to Computer Science

## Introduction

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. CS50 is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University.

- This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently

- Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming
- Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences.

> A quick word on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.

Go ahead and take a peek at the solutions.
