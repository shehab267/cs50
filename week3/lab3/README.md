## Pset 2: [Sort](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/labs/3/)

Analyze three sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use.

### Background

- Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
- Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
- Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.
