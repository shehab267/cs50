sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Omega(n)= 3.15s, and O(n^2)= 17s
    Because on already sorted its way faster than Slection sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Omega(n log n)= 3.7s, and O(n log n)= 4s
    because it's the fastest algorithm  in the revairsed value.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: OmegaO(n^2) = O(n^2) = 9s
    because it give the same value in the best and the worst senario.
